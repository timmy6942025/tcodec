# TCodec Mega TODO List

**Status**: Working prototype → Production codec  
**Last Updated**: Based on full code audit of every source file

---

## 🔴 CRITICAL BUGS (Fix Immediately)

- [x] **BUG-1**: Fix `qp_delta` unsigned wraparound — ✅ Fixed: encoder writes `(uint8_t)(int8_t)(qp - TC_QP_DEFAULT)`, decoder casts through `int8_t` and clamps with `TC_QP_MIN/MAX`.
- [x] **BUG-2**: Fix motion estimation starting at (0,0) instead of collocated block position. ✅ Fixed: search centered on median predictor MV; MVD coded relative to predictor instead of collocated.
- [x] **BUG-3**: Fix `ref_h = 2048` hardcoded in `motion.c`. ✅ Fixed: actual `ref_w`/`ref_h` passed through all callers; bounds check added before `tc_sad_subpel`.
- [x] **BUG-4**: Add MV bounds checking in decoder. ✅ Fixed: decoder checks `fx+blk_size+1 <= ref->width` before inter predict; out-of-bounds MVs fall back to DC(128).
- [x] **BUG-5**: Decoder `qp` field overflow. ✅ Fixed: same as BUG-1 (int8_t cast + clamp).

---

## 🟡 ACTIVATE EXISTING BUT UNUSED CODE

- [x] **ACT-1**: Wire JND per-coefficient band weighting — ✅ Wired: encoder/decoder apply `tc_freq_band()` + `tc_jnd_weight()` per-coefficient inline in the quantize/dequantize loops.
- [x] **ACT-2**: Wire median MV predictor — ✅ Wired: median of spatial neighbors used as ME search center AND as MVD predictor (replaces collocated). Dead `median_predictor()` function removed from motion.c.
- [x] **ACT-3**: Wire NEON SAD into pipeline — ✅ Wired: scalar `tc_sad()` guarded by `#if !TCODEC_NEON`; NEON `tc_sad()` dispatches 4×4/8×8/16×16 automatically.
- [ ] **ACT-4**: Wire NEON inter predict — `tc_inter_predict_neon()` exists but uses bilinear (not 6-tap). **Deferred** — scalar `tc_inter_predict()` uses proper 6-tap luma filter with bilinear fallback; NEON version would reduce quality. Needs rewrite to match 6-tap behavior.
- [x] **ACT-5**: Wire NEON deblock — ✅ Wired: scalar `tc_deblock_ctu()` guarded by `#if !TCODEC_NEON`; NEON `tc_deblock_ctu()` replaces it on ARM. ⚠️ NEON version uses weak-only filter (no strong mode) and 8px boundaries (vs 4px) — different behavior from scalar.
- [x] **ACT-6**: Wire NEON color convert — ✅ Wired: NEON luma with 32-bit accumulation (fixed int16 overflow); chroma/inverse match scalar for roundtrip correctness. Scalar `_internal` functions guarded by `#if !TCODEC_NEON`; public API wrappers always compiled.
- [x] **ACT-7**: Wire WPP thread pool — ✅ Wired: encoder uses per-row bitstream buffers + tANS encoders, dispatches via `tc_threadpool_run()`, merges byte-aligned row bitstreams with entry point table. Decoder reads entry point table when `TC_FLAG_WPP` is set, initializes per-row readers, dispatches WPP. Sequential fallback with inter-row byte-alignment skips. `TCODEC_NO_THREADS` compatible.

## 🎯 IMPLEMENTATION PRIORITY ORDER

**⚠️ Note on phase order.** The Master Plan recommends:
Phase 0 → Phase 1 → Phase 2 → Phase 3 → Phase 4 → ...

We did Phase 5 before Phase 1 (prioritizing compression wins early). Now Phase 0
and Phase 1 are complete. Phase 2 (Bitstream Redesign) should be done next before
Phase 3 (entropy coding changes will modify the bitstream format).

1. ~~**BUG-1** through **BUG-5**~~ — ✅ All fixed
2. ~~**ACT-1** — Wire JND band weighting~~ — ✅ Done (~2-5% BD-rate)
3. ~~**ACT-2** — Wire median MV predictor~~ — ✅ Done (~3-8% BD-rate)
4. ~~**Skip/merge inter modes**~~ — ✅ Implemented (2-bit mode field, merge derives MV from neighbors)
5. ~~**6-tap interpolation**~~ — ✅ Already implemented in scalar `tc_inter_predict()` (6-tap luma + bilinear fallback)
6. ~~**Real chroma intra prediction**~~ — ✅ CfL (chroma-from-luma) with DC blend for intra blocks
7. ~~**Multiple reference frames**~~ — ✅ 4 DPB slots, SLOW preset searches all refs, ref_idx signaled
8. ~~**Scene cut detection**~~ — ✅ Chi-squared histogram distance, forces keyframe on cut
9. **Range coder entropy** — Major BD-rate improvement over Exp-Golomb (~15-30%)
10. **Context modeling** — Stacked on top of range coder (~5-15% additional)
11. **DCT-II transforms** — Better energy compaction than WHT (~5-10%)
12. **Better partitioning** — QTBT or similar
13. **More intra modes** — 33+ angular modes
14. **In-loop restoration** — SAO, deringing
15. **Film grain strategy** — Major win for movies
16. **Mature rate control** — Lookahead, VBV, perceptual
17. **NEON inter predict rewrite** — Match 6-tap behavior (ACT-4 deferred due to quality mismatch)
18. ~~**WPP thread pool wiring**~~ — ✅ ACT-7: WPP wired for encoder and decoder with entry point table
19. **Full ARM NEON optimization** — Performance for deployment
20. **Ecosystem** — FFmpeg, containers, streaming
